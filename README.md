# PROJECT
In this system, the users can guess the word. This is the classic hangman game in which the user must guess the word displayed in front of them. Users can guess the word as long as the hangman picture is not finished. The game ends when the man is hanged and the word is not finished. The level raises the difficulty of the words. Every word in this game comes with a clue. 

In this system, there are three modes: “Chill Mode”, "Classic Mode" and “God Mode”.  In chill mode, the word difficulty increases as the level increases there is clue available for help and no time limits . If the whole person is hanged then the user will lose the game and over again. But in “Classic Mode”, the user has to only clue is available for complete the levels. and in Pro Mode is no clue and there is a time limit to complete the word  within 60 seconds. Else it will timeout and the user will lose the game.
 
# MAIN IDEA
* Request for help
* Request anonymously so no one can see except your hero
* Requests will not affect your achievements points or levels
* Help others to achieve points, tiers and ranks
* Go higher ranks by achieving higher points
* Achieve different tags
* Share your success stories with other so they help others to
* Share your achievements points, level and tiers on different social platform like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc
